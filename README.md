# Explore: More E2E testing with CRUD

In this part of the lab, we will want you to create some E2E test for the crud app provided. It is a simple note taker app with some basic functionally, and it will be   left up to you as to how testing should be conducted. We will require you to create multiple test to make sure all the different ascepts of the app are working properly together, so please write a COUPLE of test to make sure you recieve credit for this part of the lab that include ALL features of the app.(Write more than just 3 or 4 tests.) We suggest looking through the code and to play around with the app itself to help you decide what to write test about. 

And once you are ready to write test go ahead and create a new test file to house your test and whatever other supporting files you need to run E2E test in general. The delieverable for this part of the lab will be a short video, 30 seconds or less, showing all your test being conducted on the screen. Please place this video under the video folder and that will be all for the explore part of the lab.
